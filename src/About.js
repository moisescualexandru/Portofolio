				<p className='about-me'>
					I'm a Junior Full Stack Software Engineer who loves programming and building web applications, a recent graduate of the Web Developer Scholarship by Udacity and Google. During my 6 years in BRD-GSG bank, I created several internal tools and applications that automatized time-consuming processes which kindled my passion for programming and web development. I'd love to combine this passion with my skills to continue building new and innovative web applications.
